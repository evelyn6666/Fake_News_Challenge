A Two-Step Model Using SVM and MLP for Fake News Challenge

Nowadays, many fake news have negative impact on the businesses and society. It is necessary to identify such information, and therefore, the fake news challenge was proposed. The organizer has already provided a baseline method using hand crafted features. There are many approaches to implement a stance detection system, and in this project, I used machine learning methods to divide news into four categories. Firstly, I used SVM to divide news into two categories (related and unrelated) using Basic count features, Word2Vec features and Sentiment features. Then, I introduced multilayer perceptron(MLP) to classify the related news into three categories (agree, disagree and discuss) with term frequencyâ€“inverse document frequency (tf-idf).
